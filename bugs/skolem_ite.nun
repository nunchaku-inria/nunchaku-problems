# The bug appears to be in the skolemizer. The first argument of "if then else" (the condition) is
# unpolarized, because "(if P then Q else R) == ((P ==> Q) /\ ((~ P) ==> R))" -- notice that P
# occurs both negatively and positively in the latter expression.
# The most precise way to deal with "ite" in terms of polarities is to expand it (when Q and R are
# "prop"s).
